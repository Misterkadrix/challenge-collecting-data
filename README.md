# Collecting data
Type of Challenge: Consolidation

<h2>Description</h2>
This program retrieves clean infromation about properties from the website Immoweb. It runs through the 
first 10,000 pages of houses and appartments in all of Belgium and returns a fixed table of values. If some 
information has not been entered on the website, you also get an indication of that.

<h2>Installation</h2>
To be able to run the program, you must have a Python-supporting application on your device, like
PyCharm or Visual Studio Code. Through these applications, provided that you have a Python interpreter, 
you can run the program in your Terminal or Shell. If you do have Python installed, you can also run it
directly in your Terminal/Shell by navigating to the right folder and entering "python (Ceren-branch).py".

<h2>Usage</h2>
The program wil scrape the Immoweb website, collect the data and put them in a dataframe (supported by 
Pandas). The first 10,000 results will be analysed, which will take some minutes. After that, the dataframe 
is automatically converted to a .csv file, which you can open with Excel or any similar application.
